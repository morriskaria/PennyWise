## 💡 Key Takeaways Summary

### The Backend (In One Sentence)
The backend receives requests from users, validates them, checks permissions, processes the business logic, saves to database, and sends back a response.

### The Three Layers (Quickly)
```
API (entry) → Business Logic (processing) → Database (storage)
```

### Technology Purpose
- **Next.js:** Your web framework
- **React:** What users see
- **TypeScript:** Catch errors early
- **Prisma:** Easy database
- **PostgreSQL:** Store data safely
- **NextAuth:** Manage logins
- **Zod:** Validate data

### Why These Technologies Together
They work seamlessly, give you security by default, provide type safety, and make development fast and enjoyable.

### Most Important Principle
**Never trust frontend validation. Always validate and authorize on the backend.**
